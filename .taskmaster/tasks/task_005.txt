# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Explanation and Answer Generation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the functionality to automatically generate explanations and answers for the generated questions.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Question Analysis Module [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a module to analyze the generated question and identify the key concepts and information required to answer it. This module will serve as the foundation for generating both the answer and the explanation.
### Details:
Implement a function that takes a question string as input and returns a structured representation of the question, including identified keywords, entities, and the type of question being asked (e.g., definition, comparison, cause-effect). Use NLP techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER) and keyword extraction. Consider using libraries like spaCy or NLTK.

## 2. Implement Answer Generation Module [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a module to generate a concise and accurate answer to the question based on the analyzed question data. This module should retrieve relevant information and synthesize it into a coherent answer.
### Details:
Implement a function that takes the structured question representation (output of the Question Analysis Module) as input. This function should retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base (e.g., a database or a set of documents) based on the identified keywords and entities. Synthesize the retrieved information into a concise and accurate answer. Consider using techniques like text summarization and sentence generation.

## 3. Implement Explanation Generation Module [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a module to generate a detailed explanation of the answer, providing reasoning and justification for the answer. This module should explain the steps taken to arrive at the answer and cite relevant sources.
### Details:
Implement a function that takes both the structured question representation and the generated answer as input. This function should generate a detailed explanation of the answer, explaining the reasoning behind it and citing relevant sources from the knowledge base. Consider using techniques like chain-of-thought reasoning and evidence retrieval.

## 4. Integrate Modules and Implement Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate the Question Analysis, Answer Generation, and Explanation Generation modules into a cohesive system. Implement error handling to gracefully handle cases where the system cannot generate an answer or explanation.
### Details:
Create a main function that orchestrates the execution of the three modules. Implement error handling to catch exceptions and provide informative error messages to the user. Implement logging to track the execution of the system and identify potential issues.

## 5. Refine and Optimize Explanation and Answer Generation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Refine the generated explanations and answers based on user feedback and performance metrics. Optimize the system for speed and accuracy.
### Details:
Collect user feedback on the generated explanations and answers. Analyze the feedback to identify areas for improvement. Refine the algorithms and knowledge base to improve the quality of the generated explanations and answers. Optimize the system for speed and accuracy by profiling the code and identifying bottlenecks.
