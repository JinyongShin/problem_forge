# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Create a new Git repository [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize a new Git repository for the project, either locally or on a remote hosting service like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
### Details:
1. Choose a suitable remote hosting service if needed. 2. Create a new repository with a descriptive name. 3. If creating locally, use `git init` in the project directory. 4. If using a remote repository, clone it to your local machine using `git clone <repository_url>`.

## 2. Set up project directory structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and create the basic directory structure for the project, including folders for source code, tests, documentation, and other assets.
### Details:
1. Create directories such as `src` (for source code), `tests` (for unit/integration tests), `docs` (for documentation), `assets` (for images, fonts, etc.), and `scripts` (for build/deployment scripts). 2. Consider creating subdirectories within `src` based on modules or components. 3. Create an initial `README.md` file in the root directory.

## 3. Configure project build system [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Choose and configure a build system or task runner (e.g., Make, CMake, Maven, Gradle, npm, yarn) to automate build, test, and deployment processes.
### Details:
1. Select a build system appropriate for the project's language and dependencies. 2. Create a build configuration file (e.g., `Makefile`, `pom.xml`, `package.json`). 3. Define tasks for compiling code, running tests, and packaging the application. 4. Ensure the build system can resolve dependencies and manage project resources.

## 4. Set up version control ignore file [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files and directories (e.g., build artifacts, temporary files, IDE settings) from version control.
### Details:
1. Create a `.gitignore` file in the project root directory. 2. Add entries for common files and directories that should be ignored, such as `node_modules`, `.idea`, `build`, `dist`, and operating system-specific temporary files. 3. Use online resources (e.g., gitignore.io) to generate a `.gitignore` file tailored to the project's language and environment.

## 5. Configure development environment [done]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Set up the development environment with necessary tools and dependencies, including IDE, compiler, debugger, and any required libraries or frameworks.
### Details:
1. Install the necessary IDE or text editor. 2. Install the appropriate compiler or interpreter for the project's language. 3. Install any required libraries or frameworks using the build system or package manager. 4. Configure the IDE to use the correct compiler and debugger. 5. Set up environment variables as needed.
