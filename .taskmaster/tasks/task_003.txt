# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop File Conversion Module
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the module to convert PDF and image files to markdown or text format for agent processing.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement PDF to Text Conversion [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the functionality to convert PDF files to plain text format. This will involve using a suitable PDF parsing library.
### Details:
Use a library like PDFMiner or PyPDF2 in Python. Extract text content from each page of the PDF and concatenate it into a single string. Handle potential encoding issues during text extraction. Consider adding options for handling headers, footers, and tables.

## 2. Implement Image to Text Conversion (OCR) [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement Optical Character Recognition (OCR) functionality to convert images (e.g., PNG, JPG) to text format.
### Details:
Utilize an OCR library such as Tesseract OCR. Preprocess the image to improve OCR accuracy (e.g., noise reduction, deskewing, contrast adjustment). Handle different image resolutions and orientations. Consider providing options for specifying the language of the text in the image.

## 3. Implement PDF to Markdown Conversion [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the functionality to convert PDF files to Markdown format. This will involve identifying headings, lists, and other structural elements within the PDF.
### Details:
Leverage the text extraction from the PDF to Text conversion (Subtask 4). Implement logic to identify headings based on font size and style. Detect lists based on indentation and bullet points. Convert tables to Markdown table format. Handle images within the PDF by extracting them and referencing them in the Markdown output.

## 4. Create a Unified Conversion Interface [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a unified interface for the file conversion module that accepts a file (PDF or image) and a target format (text or markdown) as input and returns the converted content.
### Details:
Create a function or class that takes the file path and target format as arguments. Determine the file type based on the file extension or content. Call the appropriate conversion function (PDF to Text, Image to Text, or PDF to Markdown) based on the file type and target format. Handle errors gracefully and return informative error messages.

## 5. Integrate Error Handling and Logging [done]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms within the file conversion module to capture and report any errors or exceptions that occur during the conversion process.
### Details:
Implement try-except blocks around critical sections of the code to catch potential exceptions. Log any errors or exceptions that occur, including the file name, error message, and stack trace. Use a logging library such as Python's `logging` module. Implement a mechanism for reporting errors to the user or administrator.
