# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Unit Tests for File Input [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create unit tests to verify the file input functionality. This includes testing for valid file formats, file size limits, and error handling for corrupted or invalid files.
### Details:
Use a testing framework like Jest or Mocha. Mock file system interactions to isolate the file input logic. Test cases should cover successful file uploads, invalid file types, files exceeding size limits, and corrupted file scenarios. Ensure comprehensive error messages are displayed to the user.

## 2. Implement Integration Tests for Question Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop integration tests to validate the question generation process. This involves testing the interaction between the file input module and the question generation module, ensuring that questions are generated correctly based on the input file content.
### Details:
Use a testing framework like Cypress or Selenium. Provide sample input files and assert that the generated questions match expected outputs. Test different types of input files (e.g., text, CSV, PDF) and verify that the question generation logic handles them correctly. Focus on the accuracy and relevance of the generated questions.

## 3. Implement End-to-End Tests for Explanation Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create end-to-end tests to verify the explanation generation functionality. This includes testing the entire flow from question selection to explanation generation, ensuring that the explanations are accurate and relevant to the selected questions.
### Details:
Use a testing framework like Cypress or Playwright. Simulate user interactions, such as selecting a question and requesting an explanation. Assert that the generated explanation matches the expected output and is displayed correctly to the user. Test different question types and ensure that the explanations are tailored to each question.

## 4. Implement UI Tests for PDF Download [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop UI tests to validate the PDF download functionality. This involves testing the user interface elements related to PDF download, ensuring that the download process is initiated correctly and the generated PDF file is valid.
### Details:
Use a testing framework like Selenium or Puppeteer. Simulate user interactions, such as clicking the download button. Verify that the PDF file is downloaded successfully and that the file content matches the expected output. Test different browsers and operating systems to ensure cross-platform compatibility.

## 5. Perform Regression Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Execute a comprehensive regression test suite to ensure that existing functionalities are not broken by recent changes. This includes re-running all previously created tests (unit, integration, end-to-end, and UI) to identify any regressions.
### Details:
Create a dedicated regression test suite that includes all existing tests. Run the regression test suite automatically after each deployment or major code change. Analyze the test results and fix any identified regressions promptly. Prioritize regressions based on their severity and impact on user experience.
