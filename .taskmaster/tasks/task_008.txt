# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Minimal Demo Agent Response
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a basic agent response to confirm understanding of the input problem for minimal demo.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Input Problem Data Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define a simple data structure to represent the input problem received by the agent. This structure should include fields for problem description and any relevant constraints.
### Details:
Create a class or data structure (e.g., a Python dataclass or dictionary) to hold the input problem. Include fields like 'description' (string) and 'constraints' (list of strings). This structure will be used to pass the problem to the agent's response logic.

## 2. Implement Basic Agent Response Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the core logic for generating a basic agent response. This response should acknowledge receipt of the problem and briefly summarize the problem description.
### Details:
Create a function that takes the input problem data structure as input. Within the function, construct a simple response string that confirms understanding of the problem. For example: 'I understand the problem is: [problem description].'

## 3. Integrate Input Problem and Response Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Connect the input problem data structure to the agent response logic. Ensure the agent receives the problem and generates a response based on it.
### Details:
Modify the main agent loop (or entry point) to receive the input problem (represented by the data structure defined in subtask 9) and pass it to the response logic implemented in subtask 10. Print the generated response to the console or log.

## 4. Add Simple Constraint Acknowledgement [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Extend the agent response to acknowledge any constraints associated with the problem.
### Details:
Modify the response logic to check for the presence of constraints in the input problem data structure. If constraints exist, append a statement to the response acknowledging them. For example: 'I also understand the following constraints: [list of constraints].'

## 5. Refine Response Formatting [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Improve the formatting of the agent response to make it more readable and user-friendly.
### Details:
Adjust the response string to include line breaks, indentation, or other formatting elements to improve readability. Consider using string formatting techniques (e.g., f-strings in Python) to create a more structured response.
