# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Agent Functionality with google-adk
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the agent functionality using google-adk for question transformation, explanation/answer generation, and session management.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up google-adk environment and dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install the google-adk library and configure the necessary environment variables (e.g., API keys, project IDs).
### Details:
Use pip to install the google-adk library. Configure environment variables for authentication and project access. Verify the installation by running a simple adk command.

## 2. Implement Question Transformation Module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a module that transforms user questions into a format suitable for the underlying language model using google-adk.
### Details:
Utilize google-adk's capabilities to rephrase or simplify user questions. Implement error handling for invalid or ambiguous questions. Consider using prompt engineering techniques to guide the transformation process.

## 3. Implement Explanation/Answer Generation Module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a module that generates explanations or answers to the transformed questions using google-adk.
### Details:
Use google-adk to interact with a language model (e.g., Gemini). Implement logic to extract relevant information from the model's response and format it into a user-friendly explanation or answer. Consider using different prompting strategies to control the style and content of the generated text.

## 4. Implement Session Management Module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a module to manage user sessions, including storing conversation history and maintaining context.
### Details:
Use a suitable storage mechanism (e.g., in-memory, database) to store conversation history. Implement logic to retrieve and use previous turns in the conversation to maintain context. Consider using google-adk's session management features if available.

## 5. Integrate and Test the Agent Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate all the modules (question transformation, explanation/answer generation, and session management) into a cohesive agent functionality and perform end-to-end testing.
### Details:
Connect the modules together, ensuring that data flows correctly between them. Implement error handling and logging. Conduct end-to-end testing to verify that the agent functions as expected.
