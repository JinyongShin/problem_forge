# Subtasks:
## 1. Define UI Component Structure and Mockup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a basic structure for the UI components based on the PRD's user flow. Develop a low-fidelity mockup to visualize the layout and interactions.
### Details:
Use a wireframing tool like Balsamiq or Figma to create the mockup. Focus on placement of key elements like input fields, buttons, and data displays. Define the hierarchy of components (e.g., header, main content area, footer).

## 2. Implement Basic HTML Structure and CSS Styling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Translate the mockup into basic HTML structure with semantic elements. Apply initial CSS styling for layout, typography, and color scheme.
### Details:
Create HTML files with appropriate tags (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`). Use CSS to define basic styles. Consider using a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for rapid prototyping.

## 3. Implement Interactive Elements with JavaScript [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add JavaScript functionality to make the UI interactive. Implement event listeners for button clicks, form submissions, and other user interactions.
### Details:
Use JavaScript to handle user input and update the UI dynamically. Implement basic form validation. Consider using a JavaScript framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js for more complex interactions.

## 4. Integrate with Backend API (Placeholder) [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement placeholder API calls to simulate data fetching and submission. This will allow testing the UI's interaction with the backend before the actual API is available.
### Details:
Use JavaScript's `fetch` API or a library like Axios to make placeholder API calls. Create mock data to simulate API responses. Display the mock data in the UI.

## 5. Refine UI and Implement Accessibility Features [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Refine the UI based on feedback and testing. Implement accessibility features to ensure the UI is usable by people with disabilities.
### Details:
Address any usability issues identified during testing. Implement accessibility features such as ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and proper color contrast. Use a tool like Lighthouse to audit the UI's accessibility.
