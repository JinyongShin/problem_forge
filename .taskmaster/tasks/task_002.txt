# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Input Functionality
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the functionality to allow users to input problems via text, PDF, or image files.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Text Input Component [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a text input component in the user interface that allows users to directly type in their problems.
### Details:
Use a standard HTML textarea element or a rich text editor library (e.g., Quill, TinyMCE) for more advanced formatting. Ensure the component handles large text inputs efficiently. Implement basic validation to prevent script injection.

## 2. Implement PDF Upload Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the functionality for users to upload PDF files containing their problems.
### Details:
Use a file input element to allow users to select PDF files. Implement client-side validation to ensure that only PDF files are accepted. Use a library like PDF.js to render the PDF on the client-side or send the PDF to the server for processing.

## 3. Implement Image Upload Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the functionality for users to upload image files (e.g., JPG, PNG) containing their problems.
### Details:
Use a file input element to allow users to select image files. Implement client-side validation to ensure that only supported image formats are accepted (JPG, PNG, etc.). Display a preview of the uploaded image. Consider using a library for image manipulation (e.g., resizing, cropping).

## 4. Integrate Input Handlers [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a unified handler to process input from all three sources (text, PDF, image).
### Details:
Implement a function that receives the input data (text, PDF content, image data) and prepares it for further processing. This function should handle different data formats and potentially convert them to a common format. Implement error handling for cases where the input cannot be processed.

## 5. Implement Input Validation and Sanitization [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement robust validation and sanitization of the input data to prevent security vulnerabilities and ensure data integrity.
### Details:
Implement server-side validation to prevent malicious input. Sanitize the input data to remove potentially harmful characters or code. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse. Consider using a security library to help with validation and sanitization.
