# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Question Generation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the core function to generate various types of questions from the input problem/text.

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Question Templates and Types [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the structure and types of questions to be generated (e.g., multiple choice, true/false, short answer). Create templates for each question type, including placeholders for variable content.
### Details:
Create a JSON or YAML file to store question templates. Each template should specify the question type, a template string with placeholders, and any relevant metadata (e.g., difficulty level, subject area). Consider supporting different question types like multiple choice, true/false, and fill-in-the-blanks. Example: `{"type": "multiple_choice", "template": "What is the capital of {country}?". "options": ["{option1}", "{option2}", "{option3}", "{correct_answer}"]}`

## 2. Implement Placeholder Extraction from Input [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a function to extract relevant information from the input problem/text that can be used to fill the placeholders in the question templates.
### Details:
Use regular expressions or NLP techniques (e.g., named entity recognition, keyword extraction) to identify key pieces of information within the input text. The extracted information should correspond to the placeholders defined in the question templates. For example, if the template is 'What is the capital of {country}?', the function should extract the country name from the input text. Store the extracted information in a dictionary or similar data structure.

## 3. Implement Question Generation Logic [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the core logic to select a suitable question template based on the input and extracted information, and then populate the template with the extracted values to generate a question.
### Details:
The function should first determine the appropriate question type based on the input text and available templates. Then, it should select a template of that type and populate the placeholders with the extracted information. Handle cases where not all placeholders can be filled (e.g., by selecting a different template or generating a simpler question).

## 4. Implement Answer Generation (Optional) [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a function to generate the correct answer for the generated question. This is optional but highly desirable for automated assessment.
### Details:
Based on the question type and extracted information, generate the correct answer. For multiple-choice questions, generate a set of plausible distractors (incorrect options). This may require accessing external knowledge bases or using NLP techniques. Store the answer along with the question.

## 5. Integrate and Test End-to-End [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate all the implemented components and perform end-to-end testing to ensure the question generation process works correctly.
### Details:
Combine the placeholder extraction, question generation, and answer generation functions into a single pipeline. Test the pipeline with a variety of input texts and verify that it generates appropriate questions and answers. Address any integration issues or bugs that are identified during testing.
